# automatic-file-sorter
This project implements an automatic file sorting utility using Python, specifically leveraging the os and shutil modules. The main goal is to organize files into categorized directories based on their file types. The project is executed in a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for testing and modification.


## Key Features:

1. File Type Detection: The script identifies file types by their extensions (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .pdf, etc.).
2. Directory Creation: Automatically creates folders for each file type if they don't already exist.
3. File Sorting: Moves files to their respective directories based on their extensions.
4. Interactive Notebook: Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing users to run and tweak the code easily.

## Modules Used:

1. os: To navigate the filesystem, check file types, and create directories.
2. shutil: To move files from one location to another efficiently.
